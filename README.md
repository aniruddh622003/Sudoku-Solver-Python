# Sudoku Solver Python
 - A very basic Sudoku Solver ðŸ˜„.
 - Written in python keeping in mind the amount of people use it <img width="30px" src = "https://www.pinclipart.com/picdir/middle/269-2691398_python-logo-clipart-transparent-background-png-download.png"/>.
 - Properly Documented <img width="20px" src="https://webstockreview.net/images/document-clipart-essay.png"/>

Open [Main.py][main] follow the instructions and see your Sudoku getting solved in front of you eyes. This program uses the backtracking algorithm to solve sudokus. I know the algorithm is a bit slow, but considering the two day time-frame I had to develop this project, it felt like the best choice.

This project has some puzzles already baked into it that are randomly chosen, and can also retrieve a board from [user.txt][user] file allowing a kind of user input for the program. Again considering the time frame, it felt like the best choice ðŸ˜‰.

Feel free to use and contribute to my code. I have tried to explain almost every line of code. The app uses graphics.py library to create the GUI we see and enjoy.
